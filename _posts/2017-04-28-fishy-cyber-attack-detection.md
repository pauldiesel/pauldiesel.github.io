    Cyber attacks have become serious threats to Industrial Control systems
    as well. It becomes important to develop a serious threat defense system

    natural and artificial, that could potentially be hazardous.
    Morita proposed an effective Zone division, capable

Introduction {#sec:introduction}
============

In the age of Internet, cyber attacks have become a major threat. Until
recently only private and information centered systems were breached.
But now, cyber attacks are a threat to Industrial Systems as Well.
Serious security vulnerabilities are patched in regular personal
computers and commercial spaces, quite frequently but Industrial control
systems are seldom fixed as these patches could lead to new conflicts in
the system. This opens up a wide space for attackers to sneak in. A
prime example would be of Stuxnet, that sabotaged Iranian uranium
enrichment facilities in 2010.

The Stuxnet malware
-------------------

Stuxnet utilized existing vulnerabilities in the operating system, along
with a good understanding of the PLCs to formulate a malware. The sole
target of the malware was to manipulate the working of centrifuges that
enriched Uranium. Such carefully crafted attacks cannot be prevented
unless a perfect system is built. Instead, it is enough to detect such
breaches and then assess the damage. Thus it is important to build a
reliable security and safety mechanism to prevent against attacks like
Stuxnet.

Zone Based PCA
--------------

Hashimoto proposed a method of securing the information system by
dividing the network into “plural zones”. By Zone Division
[^hashimoto2013safety] the probability of detecting possible attacks and
accidents is increased.

Conjoined with PCA [^morita2013detection], Zone Based PCA can analyze the
relationship between the variables in *plural zones* and detect any
changes caused by potential concealed breaches and unintended accidents.
There can many types of relationships between the variables that are
analyzed differently by Zone-Based PCA. An on-board safety personnel is
still required, who may notice the change in PCA variables and report an
anomaly.

Sequence Learning
-----------------

We propose a new approach based on sequence learning algorithms, to
detect changes from regular working unlike relationships between
variables. The neural network architecture, utilized is capable of
learning how the normal functioning of the system looks like and detect
if something has changed.

In order to illustrate the working of the system, we simulate a simple
water plant, that circulates hot water between two tanks.

Simulated System
================

The simulation is a very basic version of the plant. In this system,
water circulates between two tanks (Tank1 and Tank2). The systems
contain SCADA and other operators. The plant consists of many sensors
and controls.

Variables in the System
-----------------------

L1 and L2 are levels of water in Tank1 and Tank2 respectively.
Similarly, T1 and T2 measure the temperatures. The Heater (H) provides
heat to increase the temperature of water in Tank2. The Pump (P) pumps
the heated water into Tank1. Valves V1 and V2 are controlled to allow
water to flow across them. Tank1 is assumed to radiate heat and cool
down the water.

We define two kinds of variables in our system. Process variables are
the ones that are measured by sensors. Control Variables can be
manipulated and change the state of the plant.

**Process Variables:** L1, L2, T1, T2, F1, F2, F3

**Control Variables:** V1, V2, H, P

Network Configuration of the System
-----------------------------------

The network is divided into two control zones, such that the control of
a control variable that directly affects a process variable is in a
different zone.

**Zone 1:** L1, T1, V2, F2, H

**Zone 2:** L2, T2, V1, F1, F3, P
A control variable in a zone cannot directly affect process variables in
the same zone. In the current setup, L1 depends directly on the flow F1
controlled by V1. Therefore they are being separated. The rest of the
division can be explained by similar logic fashion.

H decides the amount of heat delivered into the system. There by it
controls both T1 and T2, yet it is clubbed with T1 in Zone1 as there is
more direct dependency between H and T2 as compared to H and T1. A
formal method based on decidability matrices was presented by Hashimoto
[^hashimoto2013safety]

Zone Based PCA
==============

Principal Component analysis re-projects the data in the study into new
space, with coordinates of high variance. Thus the variables with high
variance can be maximally noted across them. PCA in a simple sense
brings down the high dimensionality of the data to a smaller number. In
our experiments, we’ve considered top 3 coordinates, in decreasing order
of variance.

<div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-04-28-fishy-cyber-attack-detection/Normal_Functioning_PCA.jpg" style="width:75%" />
</div>

The order of variance is as follows; blue, green, red in decreasing
order. The periodic nature of the plot is due to the way water is
circulated. Now we’ll simulate a data injection attack with concealment.

The attack manipulates Zone 2 and takes over the control of variables V1
and P. By setting them both to 0, the water in Tank1 doesn’t decrease
and the temperature of Tank1 increase to the extent where it
depressurizes.

The attack begins at simulation point 500.
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-04-28-fishy-cyber-attack-detection/Compromised_Functioning_PCA.jpg" style="width:75%" />
</div>

There is drastic change in the behavior of the projection in blue. Any
on-board personnel can realize such a change of high magnitude and shut
down the systems if necessary.

It becomes difficult with increasing types of manipulation to identify
what kind of change in the systems produces a particular kind of
behavior in the PCA projection.

Zone based LSTM network
=======================

The PCA method evaluates relationships between variables and raises
alarm when the relationships or the dependencies between the variables
changes. The relationships can change in many different ways when the
number of variables involved is very large.

Instead of understanding the dependency between them, we focus on
differentiating the modes of running of the plant as a whole. A normal
working state is very different from a compromised state. As the systems
tend to repetitive work, it is not hard to notice that there is a
pattern to the way an un-compromised plant produces data.

In order to achieve this, we use sequence learning LSTM networks in our
method.

Long Short Term Memory
----------------------

LSTM[^hochreiter1997long] is a form of Recurrent Neural Network, it
remembers what’s important and forgets the trivial things. It is capable
of learning patterns in data and identify those that don’t match.
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-04-28-fishy-cyber-attack-detection/lstm.png" style="width:75%" />
</div>

LSTM achieves this by what are termed as memory control gates in the
unit. There are different gates to control and filter data. The gates
decide what kind of variables at a simulation point are important. By
doing so repeatedly, it learns the values of the variables to look for
to understand the sequence pattern. It then assigns a score , that
signifies how strongly it believes in the pattern.

We train an LSTM network with a logged data of the normal functioning of
plant, and use it to give a confidence score to the previous 50 points
at every evaluation point. This enables us to know if the current
sequence of data generated is in high correlation with data generated
during normal functioning.
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-04-28-fishy-cyber-attack-detection/Normal_Functioning_NN.jpg"  style="width:75%" />
</div>

Normal functioning ensures a score match near close to 1, which is
expected.

Here we compromise zone2 in a similar fashion. Both P and V1 are set to
0 here.
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-04-28-fishy-cyber-attack-detection/Compromised_Functioning_NN_0_0.jpg" style="width:75%" />
</div>

It is to be noted that when the zone is compromised, the running of the
plant produces a different pattern of data. Then the LSTM network gives
us a correlation score with the actual pattern of functioning, which in
this case, when P is set to 0 averages around a value of 0.85.
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/posts/2017-04-28-fishy-cyber-attack-detection/Compromised_Functioning_NN_1_1.jpg" style="width:75%" />
</div>

When the variable P is set to 1, the pattern of execution produces
scores averaging around 0.8.

By thresholding at different values we can easily identify which
variable the attacker has modified. We can also detect the zone which
has been compromised.

A plausible thresholds to detect the variable could be.

**P = 0:** score $\in$ (0.8, 0.9)

**P = 1:** score $\in$ (0.75, 0.85)

Conclusion
==========

Attack Detection is of paramount importance as opposed to unearthing
vulnerabilities and fixing them, in Industrial Systems due to high
latency in patching their systems. The proposed method for intrusion
detection, based on LSTM is also capable of diagnosing the attack for
points of failure. Sequence-based learning and anomaly detection have an
advantage over PCA-based methods in this regard. This approach shows an
example of interdisciplinary work on implementing machine learning
technologies for tackling the problems of Industrial Systems and
Networks.
