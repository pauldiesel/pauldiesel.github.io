excerpt: "
    We humans have an innate tendency to question everything. We are always
    drowned in an infinite ocean of provocative thoughts, but a small stream
    keeps on asking, why is everything the way it is? Why isn’t it the other
    way around, where the Sun sets in the East? Is it even <i>Possible</i> for
    such a world to exist? We do not ever seem to be bothered by the <i>actual
    existence</i> of everyday <i>things</i> around us.

Introduction
============

We seem to be directly aware
of our immediate world somehow. How far does this immediate world
stretch? To the next room or to the stars or the very edge of the
universe itself. The point is that we seem to agree on a common belief,
<i>The Actual World</i>.

In the paper, Stalnaker, portrays the ways we try to perceive the
<i>possible worlds</i>. We study the early speculation by Leibniz to <i>extreme
realism</i> of Lewis. Particularly we understand how Stalnaker’s own brain
child <i>moderate realism</i>, coheres with Lewis theses. This review
elucidates Stalnaker’s own ideas, as well as brief history of previous
models and makes an attempt to provide the same in brief manner.

No discussion on Possible worlds can begin without going back to the
roots of skepticism. Earlier Gottfried Leibniz put forth a notion that,
**le meilleur des mondes possibles**[^6], the actual world we
live in is ***The Best One*** of infinite such worlds. His claim being
central in *theodicy*, an attempt at solving *The Problem of Evil*.

With an understanding that God being perfect!, always acts in the most
desirable manner, or that his choice is always the best, Leibniz
concluded that, “The universe that God chose to exist is the best of all
possible worlds”.[^2]

But I believe that the arguments of *theodicy*, assume that a there
exists a metric to compare the worlds. There seems to be an unchallenged
order or rank assigned to every possible world. It is based on a
pre-supposed necessity of competition between entities, similar to what
us humans have, extended into theodicy.

Even if we accept that only the *actual world* exists, we fall into an
other trap. If no possible worlds exist, why are we even discussing
them? It sure seems to be like a meta study, possibility of possible
worlds.

Putting aside the question of existence of possible worlds, possible
worlds concept has shown considerable heuristic power in providing
content to formal semantics of modal logic. In such case, in Stalnaker’s
own words, “If analysis of modal concepts in terms of possible worlds
are to be heuristic aids in mapping the relationships among formulae of
modal logic, the concept of possible worlds must be explained and
justified.” Hence it becomes necessary to not just dispose of the
concept of possible worlds as just being some mere tools, but something
of significance

Philosophical View points of Possible worlds
============================================

Several theories were proposed explaining the possible worlds. But the
central debate in all of them remained the same, whether or not these
conceptual entities we call *possible worlds*, actually exist. Realists
say that they are indeed real. Actualists stand firm on the belief that
only the *actual world* exists. Meinongianists disregard their existence
and consider them as of no significance.

The originator and, by far, the best known proponent of realism is David
Lewis. He argues and I quote, “I believe in existence of entities which
might be called ’*ways things could have been*’” and he prefers to call
them as possible worlds[^3].

The baffling thing in Lewis’s argument is the suggestion that possible
worlds are really not very different, as their name suggests. It
suggests that what seems to be a complex metaphysical concept of
possible worlds is actually an ordinary belief (the ways things could
have been) under a different name (possible worlds). This argument aims
to burden the skeptic, who worries about what problems the existence of
possible worlds might create.

Here Lewis makes an important assumption that the act of “*calling*”
(the ways things could have been) as (possible worlds), must be plain
substitution, just like the way you could decide from today onwards to
call “Apples” as “Oranges”. Stalnaker argues otherwise.

The Theses of *Extreme Realism*
===============================

Stalnaker states four theses about possible worlds, all of which are
defended by Lewis. Together they form what he calls **Extreme Realism**
about possible worlds.

-   *Possible Worlds Exists*. All possible worlds exist and are as
    *real* as the *actual* world. They might not *actually exist* in the
    *actual world* but they do, nevertheless, exist.

-   *Other possible worlds are things of same sort as the actual one*.
    In other words they differ in not the kind of things they have, but
    by the things they have in them. On the other hand the *actual*
    world is what “*I and all my surroundings*” are.

-   *The adjective **actual** has to be analyzed indexically*. The word
    *actual* referred at any world refers to the world itself.
    “*Actual*” is similar to “*I*”, it can be only referred to by the
    one being referred.

-   *Irreducability of Possible Worlds*. They cannot be broken down and
    are respectable entities on their own.

It is to this *extreme realism*, the skeptic is reacting and Stalnaker
justifies the same. He believes the doctrine is false, yet also believes
that one need to accept or reject the theses. He advocates what he calls
a *Moderate Realism*, which rejects the second theses, while accepting
the rest.

The problem of Extreme Realism
==============================

It can be seen in general agreement that thesis one is justified in the
sense that, it is what we are willing to believe for the sake of
possible worlds. But the notion that possible worlds are made up of same
kinds of things as that of the actual worlds is wrong. The second thesis
and the first thesis coil up in an inconsistent state.

Let us put things in a simpler perspective. The core claim/ rephrasing
of the claim of Lewis is that entities called “the ways things could
have been” are “possible worlds”. That its just a innocent
terminological substitution as said by Stalnaker. The first thesis says
that possible worlds exists and in justifying so, identify entities
called “the ways things might have been”. It seems only natural to
accept this thesis.

I and My Surroundings
---------------------

As was mentioned earlier, we tend to believe unconditionally in a
concept of the *Actual World*. What makes the actual world *actual* is
that fact that it is *our* world, the one where we *exist*. One might
question the very nature of *Existence*, but that’s not a discussion for
Logicians here. If we were to believe in the actual world, it must be
because we believe in the existence of ourselves and also in us, being a
part of it.

Moreover its just not us. We are also aware of the existence of the
things around of us. We are definitely sure of the air we are breathing
and its property of flow around us. But at the same we are sure of the
flow of air on the other side of earth too. Thus we have awareness of
things not just immediate to us too. This paves way for a maximally
inclusive situation encompassing all others; things as a whole or *The
Actual World*.[^4]

The way the things are!
-----------------------

Lets revisit Lewis’ original quote, [^3]

> I believe there are possible worlds other than the one we happen to
> inhabit. If an argument is wanted, it is this: It is uncontroversially
> true that things might have been otherwise than they are. I believe,
> and so do you, that things could have been different in countless
> ways. But what does this mean? Ordinary language permits the
> paraphrase: there are many ways things could have been besides the way
> that they actually are. On the face of it, this sentence is an
> existential quantification. It says that there exist many entities of
> a certain description, to wit, “ways things could have been”. I
> believe things could have been different in countless ways. I believe
> permissible paraphrases of what I believe; taking the paraphrase at
> its face value, I therefore believe in the existence of entities which
> might be called “ways things could have been”. I prefer to call them
> “possible worlds”.

Re-examine how “*the ways things could have been*” can be substituted
with “*possible worlds*”. This leads to an interesting result. If “*the
ways things could have been*” are indeed “*possible worlds*”, which we
believe exist owing to thesis one, then “*actual world*” is nothing but
the “*way the things are*”.

The inconsistency
-----------------

We have now two different ways of looking at what an *Actual world* is.
It is both “*the way the things are*” and “*I and my surroundings*”,
which translates to “*the things*” themselves.

In other words, A world is the way it is. At the first sight this
statement might seem true. But “*The way the world is*” is a property of
the world, not the world itself. This poses a serious problem as
properties can exist without the object of which the property is being
said actually being existent.

Think of an object called “Apple”, it has a property called “Color”,
Even though the actual fruit doesn’t exist, the abstract property of
“Red Color” can exist, without a “*Red Apple*”, being actually present.
In the same way “*The way the world is*” can exist without having the
“*world*” that is that way to exist.

**The way the world is, is the world**, is the problem. Since properties
can exist uninstantiated, without their objects, it is quite *possible*
that *The way a possible world ’x’ is* may exist in the *actual world*,
without the *possible world ’x’* actually existing. In fact it might be
true for all possible worlds. Hence it is *possible* that *possible
worlds* do not exist.

What is Real?
=============

The third thesis says that the actual world has no extra benefits or is
in any way privileged to be so. It is no more real than the rest. So
possible worlds are as real as the actual world. The word “actual” in
the “actual world” does not indicate any special property of the “actual
world” that sets it apart from the others.

Similarly a statement, “a is actual”, does not assign any special
properties to “a”. Rather “actual” is like “I”, “I” am just like the
rest of the human beings, when I refer to “I”, it is a reference to
self, nothing more. A reference to “I” doesn’t elevate my stature, it
simply refers to the one that made the reference. In a simpler way,
saying “actual” is no way special, and it refers to only one “actual
world”, the one that’s referring. Hence we can say that the third thesis
entails the second one.

Interestingly one can perform a semantical analysis of things without
bothering about the actuality. We can perform and accept an indexical
analysis of tenses, while believing that past and future don’t exist.
Past exists only in memory and future is only an anticipation. One can
accept the indexical analysis of actuality while excluding from one’s
ontology any universes that are the way things might have been (possible
worlds). [^4]

In fact , Stalnaker argues and I quote, “One must exclude those
analogues of our universe from one’s ontology”. We cannot sensibly deny
the claim that the actual world along is real, because ’the actual
world’ is everything there is, on the same lines as “I” being only me,
excluding everything else.

World Stories!
==============

If we indeed identify possible worlds with ways things might have been,
can we still hold that they are “Respectable entities in their own
right” that are irreducible. Robert Adams has argued that to prevent
extreme realism, we must find a eliminative strategy to reduce possible
worlds.

“If there are any true statements in which there, are said to be
non-actual possible worlds,”, he argues and I quote, “they must be
reducible to statements in which the only things there are said to be
are things which are in the actual world, and which are not identical
with non-actual possibles”[^1]

Adam presents us with an analysis of “*World Story*” that it is a
maximal consistent set of propositions. That is, it is a set which has
as its members one member of every pair of mutually contradictory
propositions, and which is such that it is possible for all of its
members to be true together. The notion of a possible world can be given
a contextual analysis in terms of world-stories.

Although there are three undefined notions in the above analyis, namely,
*proposition*, *possibility* and *contradictory*. By properly defining
them we can generate a minimal world story theory.

We can do an exercise of converting the world story theory to a possible
worlds analysis of propositions and convey the following. The minimal
theory is indeed a minimal theory of propositions. And every step in the
process of change of minimal theory into possible world theory is guided
by independent assumptions about the propositions or by the formulation
itself. Then the possible worlds analysis is not just a theory that make
assumptions, but it is the whole content of analysis.

Hence if there are objects that are propositions, and if we accept the
assumptions about the properties of the objects and their sets, then we
must accept there will be things that have all properties a possible
world theory gives the possible worlds, and that a proposition can be
reduced into a possible world.

Conclusion
==========

A question still remains. Does the form of realism about possible worlds
that Stalnaker wants to defend, a form of realism? In the sense that the
account of realism by possible worlds in itself might suffer from a
state of not being real! Such a defense would require a full scale
development and defense of the realism of possible worlds itself.

Stalnaker concludes his paper, by reiterating that, he tried to show
that his moderate realism is a coherent thesis, that rejects extreme
realism, at the same time takes the realism of possible worlds
seriously. Moderate realism treats the realism of possible worlds as
something more than just a myth or a notional trick, but as universe
something like our own.

My own mind says that realism tries too hard to establish that the
possible worlds do exist. Interpreting the possible worlds as
abstractions like the set of propositions as laid out by Adam, in the
form of word stories, would help us answer a lot of questions, but would
not give us any insight on why it worked.
