How far does this immediate world stretch? To the next room or to the stars or the very edge of the universe itself. The point is that we seem to agree on a common belief, <i>The Actual World</i>.<p>In the paper, Stalnaker, portrays the ways we try to perceive the <i>possible worlds</i>. We study the early speculation by Leibniz to <i>extreme realism</i> of Lewis. Particularly we understand how Stalnaker’s own brain child <i>moderate realism</i>, coheres with Lewis theses. This review elucidates Stalnaker’s own ideas, as well as brief history of previous models and makes an attempt to provide the same in brief manner.<p>No discussion on Possible worlds can begin without going back to the roots of skepticism. Earlier Gottfried Leibniz put forth a notion that, <strong>le meilleur des mondes possibles</strong><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, the actual world we live in is <strong><em>The Best One</em></strong> of infinite such worlds. His claim being central in <em>theodicy</em>, an attempt at solving <em>The Problem of Evil</em>.<p>With an understanding that God being perfect!, always acts in the most desirable manner, or that his choice is always the best, Leibniz concluded that, “The universe that God chose to exist is the best of all possible worlds”.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> <center> <img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/2017-04-21-possible-worlds/possible-worlds.jpg" width="75%" /> </center><p>But I believe that the arguments of <em>theodicy</em>, assume that a there exists a metric to compare the worlds. There seems to be an unchallenged order or rank assigned to every possible world. It is based on a pre-supposed necessity of competition between entities, similar to what us humans have, extended into theodicy.<p>Even if we accept that only the <em>actual world</em> exists, we fall into an other trap. If no possible worlds exist, why are we even discussing them? It sure seems to be like a meta study, possibility of possible worlds.<p>Putting aside the question of existence of possible worlds, possible worlds concept has shown considerable heuristic power in providing content to formal semantics of modal logic. In such case, in Stalnaker’s own words, “If analysis of modal concepts in terms of possible worlds are to be heuristic aids in mapping the relationships among formulae of modal logic, the concept of possible worlds must be explained and justified.” Hence it becomes necessary to not just dispose of the concept of possible worlds as just being some mere tools, but something of significance<h1 id="philosophical-view-points-of-possible-worlds">Philosophical View points of Possible worlds</h1><p>Several theories were proposed explaining the possible worlds. But the central debate in all of them remained the same, whether or not these conceptual entities we call <em>possible worlds</em>, actually exist. Realists say that they are indeed real. Actualists stand firm on the belief that only the <em>actual world</em> exists. Meinongianists disregard their existence and consider them as of no significance.<p>The originator and, by far, the best known proponent of realism is David Lewis. He argues and I quote, “I believe in existence of entities which might be called ’<em>ways things could have been</em>’” and he prefers to call them as possible worlds<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.<p>The baffling thing in Lewis’s argument is the suggestion that possible worlds are really not very different, as their name suggests. It suggests that what seems to be a complex metaphysical concept of possible worlds is actually an ordinary belief (the ways things could have been) under a different name (possible worlds). This argument aims to burden the skeptic, who worries about what problems the existence of possible worlds might create.<p>Here Lewis makes an important assumption that the act of “<em>calling</em>” (the ways things could have been) as (possible worlds), must be plain substitution, just like the way you could decide from today onwards to call “Apples” as “Oranges”. Stalnaker argues otherwise.<h1 id="the-theses-of-extreme-realism">The Theses of <em>Extreme Realism</em></h1><p>Stalnaker states four theses about possible worlds, all of which are defended by Lewis. Together they form what he calls <strong>Extreme Realism</strong> about possible worlds.<ul><li><p><em>Possible Worlds Exists</em>. All possible worlds exist and are as <em>real</em> as the <em>actual</em> world. They might not <em>actually exist</em> in the <em>actual world</em> but they do, nevertheless, exist.<li><p><em>Other possible worlds are things of same sort as the actual one</em>. In other words they differ in not the kind of things they have, but by the things they have in them. On the other hand the <em>actual</em> world is what “<em>I and all my surroundings</em>” are.<li><p><em>The adjective <strong>actual</strong> has to be analyzed indexically</em>. The word <em>actual</em> referred at any world refers to the world itself. “<em>Actual</em>” is similar to “<em>I</em>”, it can be only referred to by the one being referred.<li><p><em>Irreducability of Possible Worlds</em>. They cannot be broken down and are respectable entities on their own.</ul><p>It is to this <em>extreme realism</em>, the skeptic is reacting and Stalnaker justifies the same. He believes the doctrine is false, yet also believes that one need to accept or reject the theses. He advocates what he calls a <em>Moderate Realism</em>, which rejects the second theses, while accepting the rest.<h1 id="the-problem-of-extreme-realism">The problem of Extreme Realism</h1><p>It can be seen in general agreement that thesis one is justified in the sense that, it is what we are willing to believe for the sake of possible worlds. But the notion that possible worlds are made up of same kinds of things as that of the actual worlds is wrong. The second thesis and the first thesis coil up in an inconsistent state.<p>Let us put things in a simpler perspective. The core claim/ rephrasing of the claim of Lewis is that entities called “the ways things could have been” are “possible worlds”. That its just a innocent terminological substitution as said by Stalnaker. The first thesis says that possible worlds exists and in justifying so, identify entities called “the ways things might have been”. It seems only natural to accept this thesis.<h2 id="i-and-my-surroundings">I and My Surroundings</h2><p>As was mentioned earlier, we tend to believe unconditionally in a concept of the <em>Actual World</em>. What makes the actual world <em>actual</em> is that fact that it is <em>our</em> world, the one where we <em>exist</em>. One might question the very nature of <em>Existence</em>, but that’s not a discussion for Logicians here. If we were to believe in the actual world, it must be because we believe in the existence of ourselves and also in us, being a part of it.<p>Moreover its just not us. We are also aware of the existence of the things around of us. We are definitely sure of the air we are breathing and its property of flow around us. But at the same we are sure of the flow of air on the other side of earth too. Thus we have awareness of things not just immediate to us too. This paves way for a maximally inclusive situation encompassing all others; things as a whole or <em>The Actual World</em>.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup><h2 id="the-way-the-things-are">The way the things are!</h2><p>Lets revisit Lewis’ original quote, <sup id="fnref:3:1"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup><blockquote><p>I believe there are possible worlds other than the one we happen to inhabit. If an argument is wanted, it is this: It is uncontroversially true that things might have been otherwise than they are. I believe, and so do you, that things could have been different in countless ways. But what does this mean? Ordinary language permits the paraphrase: there are many ways things could have been besides the way that they actually are. On the face of it, this sentence is an existential quantification. It says that there exist many entities of a certain description, to wit, “ways things could have been”. I believe things could have been different in countless ways. I believe permissible paraphrases of what I believe; taking the paraphrase at its face value, I therefore believe in the existence of entities which might be called “ways things could have been”. I prefer to call them “possible worlds”.</blockquote><p>Re-examine how “<em>the ways things could have been</em>” can be substituted with “<em>possible worlds</em>”. This leads to an interesting result. If “<em>the ways things could have been</em>” are indeed “<em>possible worlds</em>”, which we believe exist owing to thesis one, then “<em>actual world</em>” is nothing but the “<em>way the things are</em>”.<h2 id="the-inconsistency">The inconsistency</h2><p>We have now two different ways of looking at what an <em>Actual world</em> is. It is both “<em>the way the things are</em>” and “<em>I and my surroundings</em>”, which translates to “<em>the things</em>” themselves.<p>In other words, A world is the way it is. At the first sight this statement might seem true. But “<em>The way the world is</em>” is a property of the world, not the world itself. This poses a serious problem as properties can exist without the object of which the property is being said actually being existent.<p>Think of an object called “Apple”, it has a property called “Color”, Even though the actual fruit doesn’t exist, the abstract property of “Red Color” can exist, without a “<em>Red Apple</em>”, being actually present. In the same way “<em>The way the world is</em>” can exist without having the “<em>world</em>” that is that way to exist.<p><strong>The way the world is, is the world</strong>, is the problem. Since properties can exist uninstantiated, without their objects, it is quite <em>possible</em> that <em>The way a possible world ’x’ is</em> may exist in the <em>actual world</em>, without the <em>possible world ’x’</em> actually existing. In fact it might be true for all possible worlds. Hence it is <em>possible</em> that <em>possible worlds</em> do not exist.<h1 id="what-is-real">What is Real?</h1><p>The third thesis says that the actual world has no extra benefits or is in any way privileged to be so. It is no more real than the rest. So possible worlds are as real as the actual world. The word “actual” in the “actual world” does not indicate any special property of the “actual world” that sets it apart from the others.<p>Similarly a statement, “a is actual”, does not assign any special properties to “a”. Rather “actual” is like “I”, “I” am just like the rest of the human beings, when I refer to “I”, it is a reference to self, nothing more. A reference to “I” doesn’t elevate my stature, it simply refers to the one that made the reference. In a simpler way, saying “actual” is no way special, and it refers to only one “actual world”, the one that’s referring. Hence we can say that the third thesis entails the second one.<p>Interestingly one can perform a semantical analysis of things without bothering about the actuality. We can perform and accept an indexical analysis of tenses, while believing that past and future don’t exist. Past exists only in memory and future is only an anticipation. One can accept the indexical analysis of actuality while excluding from one’s ontology any universes that are the way things might have been (possible worlds). <sup id="fnref:4:1"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup><p>In fact , Stalnaker argues and I quote, “One must exclude those analogues of our universe from one’s ontology”. We cannot sensibly deny the claim that the actual world along is real, because ’the actual world’ is everything there is, on the same lines as “I” being only me, excluding everything else.<h1 id="world-stories">World Stories!</h1><p>If we indeed identify possible worlds with ways things might have been, can we still hold that they are “Respectable entities in their own right” that are irreducible. Robert Adams has argued that to prevent extreme realism, we must find a eliminative strategy to reduce possible worlds.<p>“If there are any true statements in which there, are said to be non-actual possible worlds,”, he argues and I quote, “they must be reducible to statements in which the only things there are said to be are things which are in the actual world, and which are not identical with non-actual possibles”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">5</a></sup><p>Adam presents us with an analysis of “<em>World Story</em>” that it is a maximal consistent set of propositions. That is, it is a set which has as its members one member of every pair of mutually contradictory propositions, and which is such that it is possible for all of its members to be true together. The notion of a possible world can be given a contextual analysis in terms of world-stories.<p>Although there are three undefined notions in the above analyis, namely, <em>proposition</em>, <em>possibility</em> and <em>contradictory</em>. By properly defining them we can generate a minimal world story theory.<p>We can do an exercise of converting the world story theory to a possible worlds analysis of propositions and convey the following. The minimal theory is indeed a minimal theory of propositions. And every step in the process of change of minimal theory into possible world theory is guided by independent assumptions about the propositions or by the formulation itself. Then the possible worlds analysis is not just a theory that make assumptions, but it is the whole content of analysis.<p>Hence if there are objects that are propositions, and if we accept the assumptions about the properties of the objects and their sets, then we must accept there will be things that have all properties a possible world theory gives the possible worlds, and that a proposition can be reduced into a possible world.<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p>A question still remains. Does the form of realism about possible worlds that Stalnaker wants to defend, a form of realism? In the sense that the account of realism by possible worlds in itself might suffer from a state of not being real! Such a defense would require a full scale development and defense of the realism of possible worlds itself.<p>Stalnaker concludes his paper, by reiterating that, he tried to show that his moderate realism is a coherent thesis, that rejects extreme realism, at the same time takes the realism of possible worlds seriously. Moderate realism treats the realism of possible worlds as something more than just a myth or a notional trick, but as universe something like our own.<p>My own mind says that realism tries too hard to establish that the possible worlds do exist. Interpreting the possible worlds as abstractions like the set of propositions as laid out by Adam, in the form of word stories, would help us answer a lot of questions, but would not give us any insight on why it worked.<h1 id="references">References</h1><div class="footnotes"><ol><li id="fn:6"><p>Wikipedia.
